                                p Ramabot allows the conditional conversation through the use of ‘RQ Jump. The ‘RQ’ in the RQ Jump stands for ‘Rational Quotient’. RQ Jump allows you to create conditional jumps in the conversation based on a user input. For example, during a conversation, your bot may ask a user which one does she/he like more, Iron Man or Captain America? User X might say she likes Iron man while User Y might say he likes Captain America. RQ Jump allows the bot to have a different set of follow-up conversations upon such selection. For User X, Bot might continue conversation saying “Great Choice, Robert Downey Jr Rocks!” and for User Y, Bot might say “Hey! how good was Chris Evans as Captain America!”
